				<h3>Liquid</h3>
				<p>
					Waste can come in non-solid form. Some solid waste can also be converted to a liquid waste form for
					disposal. It includes point source and non-point source discharges such as storm water and
					wastewater. Examples of liquid waste include wash water from homes, liquids used for cleaning in
					industries and waste detergents.

				<h3>Solid</h3>

					places. These include old car tires, old newspapers, broken furniture and even food waste. They may

				<h3>Organic</h3>
				<p>
					Organic waste comes from plants or animals sources. Commonly, they include food waste, fruit and
					vegetable peels, flower trimmings and even dog poop can be classified as organic waste. They are
					biodegradable (this means they are easily broken down by other organisms over time and turned into
					manure). Many people turn their organic waste into compost and use them in their gardens.

				<h3>Recyclable</h3>
				<p>
					Recycling is processing used materials (waste) into new, useful products. This is done to reduce the
					use of raw materials that would have been used. Waste that can be potentially recycled is termed
					"Recyclable waste". Aluminum products (like soda, milk and tomato cans), Plastics (grocery shopping
					bags, plastic bottles), Glass products (like wine and beer bottles, broken glass), Paper products
					(used envelopes, newspapers and magazines, cardboard boxes) can be recycled and fall into this
					category.
