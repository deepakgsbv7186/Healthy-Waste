				<ul>
					<li>#1 You can decrease water usage by exploiting water-saving appliances, use baking soda and
						vinegar for cleaning your house, collect rainwater and recycle it. Do not pollute water with
						chemicals and other contaminants. You can also take shorter showers and use low-flow
						showerheads.</li>
					<li>#2 Conserve electricity. Turn off light in the rooms you are not in, unplug electronic
						appliances that are not in use. Change your regular bulbs to fluorescent or LED bulbs.</li>
					<li>#3 Segregate your rubbish so that it could be easier to recycle. Use separate trash bags for
						metal cans, paper and plastic.</li>
					<li>#4 Use public transport or carpool when going to work. Let your children take school bus instead
						of driving them to school by your own car.</li>
					<li>#5 When shopping pay attention to the manufacturers that use recyclable packaging. Do not use
						polythene bags and do not take additionally packed products as fruit and vegetables.</li>
					<li>#6 Plant trees and join Greenpeace communities, be active in green movement and participate in
						their activities.</li>
					<li>#7 Do not throw away garbage that can be recycled. Such things as batteries and cell phones
						contain hazardous pollutants.</li>
					<li>#8 Do not turn on your heating system to high temperatures, you would rather dress better.
						Besides, you can sleep better when it is not very hot in your bedroom.</li>
